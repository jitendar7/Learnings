Requests => Stores in WorkManager Database
If 23+, send the request
If 22-, has google play services & work-gcm ? GCMNetworkManager : AlarmManager

If the app is forced stop, all the work requests are stopped gracefully

How to avoid running duplicate work requests again & again

in activity onCreate()
WorkManager.getInstance(this).enqueUniquePeriodicWork(
    "test_work",
    ExistingPeriodicWorkPolicy.KEEP,
    PeriodicWorkRequestBuilder<TestWorker>(duration).build())

Two types of Initialization:
- Automatic
- OnDemand

gets the configuration ( implements Configuration.Provider )

How to test Workers:

extends CoroutineWorker

runBlocking{
val worker = TestListenableWorkerBuilder<TestWorker>(context)
            .setInputData(workDataOf("key" to 10))
            .setRunAttemptCount(2)
            .build()

val result = worker.startWork().await()
assertThat(result).isEqualTo(Result.success())
}

extends Worker ( executed on background thread )

runBlocking{
val executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor()
val worker = TestWorkerBuilder<TestWorker>(context, executor)
             .setInputData(workDataOf("key" to 10L)
             .setRunAttemptCount(2)
             .build()

val result = worker.startWork().await()
assertThat(result).isEqualTo(Result.success))

}

- Testing with constraints & delays
