Ref: https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/command

Intent:
Encapsulate request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different
requests, queue or log requests and support undo operations

eg: Transaction

Participants:
Command - interface for executing an operation
ConcreteCommand (PasteCommand, OpenCommand)
    - defines a binding object between receiver & an action

Client - creates a ConcreteCommand & sets its receiver
Invoker (MenuItem/Button/Shortcut)
    - asks the command to carry out the request
Receiver (Document Application)
    - knows how to perform the operations associated with carrying out a request


Memento can keep state the command requires to undo its effect
A command that must be copied before placed on the history list acts as a Prototype
A Composite can be used to implement Macro Commands
