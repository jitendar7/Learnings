Intent:
Lets you to separate operational logic from objects on which they operate to another class.
Performing an operation on a group of similar kinds of objects.


Participants:

Visitor
- declares visit operation for each of concrete element in the object structure

Concrete Visitor
- implement each operation declared by visitor,
  each operation implements a fragment of the algorithm defined for the corresponding class of object
  in the structure.

Element
- defines an 'accept' operation that takes a visitor as an argument

ConcreteElement
- implement an accept operation that takes a visitor as an argument


ObjectStructure
- can enumerate its elements
- may provide a high-level interface to allow the visitor to visit its elements
- may either be composite or a collection such as list or a set
