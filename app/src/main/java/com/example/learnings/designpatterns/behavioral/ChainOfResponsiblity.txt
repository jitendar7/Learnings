Ref: https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/chain-of-responsibility

Intent:
Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance
to handle it

eg: Context driven help window, Authorization & Authentication steps ,
    making use of handlers to pass the request to other receivers

    IVR system, is a real world analogy

If it doesn't matter who is sending the requests & who is receiving the requests

Structure:

    Handler
    Concrete Handlers
    Client

Consequences:
Reduced Coupling, Added flexibility in assigning responsibilities to objects


This is applied in conjunction with Composite pattern
