Intent:
Compose into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies

Participants:

Composite (Graphic)
 - interface for objects in the composition
 - implements default behavior for the interface common to all classes

Leaf (Rectangle, Line, Text , etc.. )
 - represents leaf objects in the composition
 - defines behavior for primitive objects in the composition

Composite (Picture)
 - defines behavior for components having children
 - stores child components
 - implement child related operations in the component interface

Client
 - manipulates objects in the composition through Component interface

Decorator is often used with Composite,
Decorators will have to support Component interface

Iterator can be used to traverse composites
