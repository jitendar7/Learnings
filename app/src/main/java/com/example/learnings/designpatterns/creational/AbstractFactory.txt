Ref: https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/abstract-factory

Intent:
Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects
without specifying their concrete classes

eg: ToolKit for Windows, Mac


Use it when the system should be independent of how its products are created,
composed, and represented

A system should be configured with one  of multiple families of products


Supporting new kinds of products is difficult, creating products
To solve this problem, for creating many product families, the concrete factory can be implemented
using the Prototype pattern.

A concrete factory is often singleton
