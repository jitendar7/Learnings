Intent:
Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access it

Motivation:
One reason for controlling access to an object is to defer the full cost of its creation
and initialization until we actually need to use it.

Example:
Placeholder for image object in a document

Credit card or cheque is a proxy for what is in our bank account.
It is used in-place of cash, and provides a means of accessing that cash when required
"Controls & manage access to the object they are protecting"

Remote Proxy, Virtual Proxy, Protection proxy, Smart Proxy


Internet, RealInternet

It's interface may be a subset of subject's
Decorator adds one or more responsibilities to an object, where as a
proxy controls access to an object.

Protection proxy might be implemented exactly like a decorator
Remote proxy will not contain a direct reference to its real subject but only
indirect reference, such as "host ID and local address on host"
