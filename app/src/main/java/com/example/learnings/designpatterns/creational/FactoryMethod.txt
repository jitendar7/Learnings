Intent:
Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
'Factory Method' lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

Participants:

Product(Document)
ConcreteProduct(MyDocument)
 - implements Product interface

Creator (Application)
- declares the factory method, which returns the interface Product,
  it can also define a default ConcreteProduct object
- may call the factory method to create a Product object

ConcreteCreator (MyApplication)
- overrides the factory method to return an instance of a ConcreteProduct


Factory methods are usually called within Template Methods.
