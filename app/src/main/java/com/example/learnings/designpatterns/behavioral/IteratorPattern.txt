Ref: https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/iterator

Intent:
Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without
exposing its underlying representation


eg: FacebookIterator, LinkedInIterator,...


Participants:

Iterator
    - defines an interface for accessing and traversing elements
ConcreteIterator
    - implementation of interface

Aggregate
    - defines an interface for creating an Iterator object

ConcreteAggregate
    - implements the Iterator creation interface to return an instance of the proper
      ConcreteIterator
