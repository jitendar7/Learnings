Ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern

Intent:
Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.


Participants:
Facade (Compiler)
 -  knows which subsystem classes are responsible for a request
 -  delegates client requests to appropriate subsystem objects

Subsystem classes (Scanner, Parser, ProgramNode, etc..)
 - implement subsystem functionality
 - handle work assigned by the Facade object
