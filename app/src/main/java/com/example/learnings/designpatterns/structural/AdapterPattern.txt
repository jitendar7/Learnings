Reference for Pic: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern

Intent:
Adapter converts from one interface to another interface

Object Adapter -
relies on object composition

Class Adapter -
relies on multiple inheritance


Client - it expects, to use a target interface
Target -  target Interface
Adapter - implements Target interface, & has the 'Adaptee' object / inherits 'Adaptee' class & converted to target interface
Adaptee - existing interface that needs adapting


Adapter is meant to change the interface of an existing object
Decorator enhances another object without changing its interface. This is more transparent to the application than an adapter is
Proxy, defines a representative or surrogate for another object & doesnot change its interface
